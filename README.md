# TerminalTots NFT Project

TerminalTots is an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) project written in Python. With designs inspired by the retro terminals of early computing, each TerminalTot is unique in its appearance. 

Future update ideas: 
* More colors and faces
* Multiple body shapes 
* Accessories (hats, jewelry)

## Getting Started

### Dependencies (Python)
* Glob
* Pillow 
* Itertools

### Executing program
To create a series of TerminalTots, simply run the generate tots file:
```
python3 generate_tots.py
```

The program will create image files (PNG) of every possible combination of body and face assets.
